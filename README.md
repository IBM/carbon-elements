> IBM Design Language in digital and software products. This project contains a
> collection of packages for different elements of this language. We'll be
> introducing additional elements over the next several months.

## Quick Start

To get started with one of the element packages, you can run one of the
following commands:

Run the following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/icons
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/icons
```

In this case, `icons` is the elements package name that you could install from
this project.
