## Getting started

Carbon elements is a collection of packages that enable developers to use the
IBM Design Language in code. We current offer the following packages that you
can start using today:

- [`@carbon/colors`](./packages/colors) for working with colors like Blue 50
- [`@carbon/grid`](./packages/grid) for building layouts using the new 16 column
  grid system
- [`@carbon/icons`](./packages/icons) for working with iconography assets. We also
  offer support for icons in a variety of frameworks, including:
  - [React](./packages/icons-react)
  - [Angular](./packages/icons-angular)
  - [Vue](./packages/icons-vue)
- [`@carbon/layout`](./packages/layout) for working with new layout-based units
  and our spacing scale
- [`@carbon/motion`](./packages/motion) for working with productive and
  expressive motion curves
- [`@carbon/themes`](./packages/themes) for working with the color tokens
  available in the Carbon Design System, like `$interactive-01`
- [`@carbon/type`](./packages/type) for working with the new type tokens
  alongside IBM Plex

While you can use each package individually if you would like, we also offer a
bundled version of these packages in [`@carbon/elements`](./packages/elements).
