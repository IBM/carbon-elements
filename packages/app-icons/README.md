# IBM App Icons

> IBMâ€™s app icons are visual symbols used to represent products or services. They allow users to identify apps at a glance while serving as a unique expression of our brand. An app icon is one of the first elements of an app that users see, so it is essential to make a strong first impression that communicates quality and purpose.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [App Icon Guidelines](www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/app-icons) for icon design guidance.

Design and produce app icons with the [App Icon builder and template](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-elements/tree/master/packages/app-icons/app-icon-template).

## Approval process

App icons should go through this design review process to ensure consistency and proper representation of the IBM brand across all environments. 

Please submit new icons here for approval by [creating an issue](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-elements/issues/new?template=app-icon-approval-request.md).
